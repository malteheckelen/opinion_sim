## MaDisBe - Mass Discourse Behaviour

An Opinion Dynamics model with dual process decision architecture. 

Aim: Relate previous results of Bounded Confidence models that have relatively black box agent designs to assumptions and dual process models of social influence, persuasion in small group settings  and general decision theory from Sociology that theoretically bridges the micro and the macro level through a meso "norm" level.

Implemented in R.
